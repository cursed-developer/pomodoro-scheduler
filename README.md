## How it works
The app follow the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique), breaking the time into two intervals, 25 min to work and 5 min to rest.

You can set the time of the intervals on the configuration, put your device and silent mode and keep the screen on to see the timer.
