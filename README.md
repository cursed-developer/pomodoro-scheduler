# Pomodoro scheduler
## About this project
It is a simple countdown using ``pomodoro technique``, developed in jetpack compose and kotlin, following my own [figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/Y6oJ51KCgG7vcZNQN8ZDu0/Pomodoro).

## How it works
When you press ``start``, the pomodoro will start with a duration of 25 minutes, followed by a 5 minute rest. 

You can swipe between ``day`` and ``night`` pressing the ``moon`` button
